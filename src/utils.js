In fact, much of the MEGAMIX's recreational space is set aside for advanced quantum meditation, high-level hyperintellectual theoryplay, and meta-dialoguing.\n\nSlaver: The MEGAMIX was converted to a slave ship after the star anvil was destroyed (signaling the commencement of the Ten-Thousand Year Hostilities). Zarquanian slavery is more brutal and monstrous than anything we humans could ever imagine (or even have the language to adequately describe). The slaves of Zarquans must at all time be kept away from anything that can be used as a makeshift weapon-not for fear of revolt, but because the slaves will commit suicide at the first possible chance.

      "Final Narrative - the calculation of the final outcome of the Universe (fake) with the total enterprise of all life on all planets as a quantifiable factor - must be constantly repostulated, reformulated, model projected and spell checked by interested parties at exponentially-increasing cost. The most efficient vehicle for this calculation is a special type of think tank org filled with semi-senient human computers which are networked together to create something effectively like The World's Smartest Man.\n\nThe computers (drooling vegetable people, clones, lobotomized sex workers and kidnapped transients) are enormously expensive to create, and require a full-time support staff of caregivers, baby food chefs, massage therapists (for the bed sores), lawyers (to make sure it's ethical) etc... But, to The Powers That Be, the cost is an investment that ensures they get to stay well ahead of the re-formulation curve and the Potential Parallel Worlds Time-ConeTM (which reaps alternate futures from the realm of possibility at the Speed of Speed).\n\nFinal Narrative organizations always set up their egghead engineer-mathematicians on the Fifth Floor or whatever building they're nominally \"located\" in. The lobbies are usually spiffed up for PR purposes, with a cute little coffee shop and visitor center, or perhaps a lecture hall hosting Narrative Outlook 101 (a free community series for the idigenous and disabled to get their feet wet in the exciting field of Narrative Study)... But then after hoofing it up a floor or two (the elevators are out of comish) it becomes clear from the disconnected phones and lack of organized human activity that you're in a shell game or some type of M.C. Escher-esque pinball maze. Where are the computers? There better be a fully-stocked bar at the top of these stairs. What the hell is going on, on the Fifth Floor?\n\nDidn't Happen; Can't Prove It Did; Debunked: Institutionally gaslight your opponent into thinking his/her last turn didn't happen. There are obvious stacks of paperwork to prove it and multiple expert witnesses including a best-selling author and a well-liked TV personality. Opponent's ex is a character witness for the prosecution: he/she is a narcissistic abuser who day drinks and plays fast and loose with the truth (bad credit score too).\n  Remove all DMG and status effects caused by last enemy turn.",

      "\"Jeff Bezos knew what he was doing when he made that dick ship.\"\n\n///Why do all alien ships in movies look like logs of shit? Is that an international marketing decision passed down to the art department? Serious question, just spitballing (this card has no effect).\n\nFast Fact v1.1.1: The Zarquans are one of the earliest space-faring races to view the females and homosexuals of their species as equal. The MEGAMIX has been helmed by a female (Zarquanian gender equivalent) captain since its maiden voyage! Awesome!\n\nFast Facts v2.2.2; Zarquanian pleasure cruisers such as the MEGAMIX aren;t all just about exotic hyperbuffets, intergalactic hedonism, getting drunk in other star systems, etc. While they do know how to party down and have a good time, the Zarquans are also extremely spiritually and philosophically advanced. In fact, much of the MEGAMIX's recreational space is set aside for advanced quantum meditation, high-level hyperintellectual theoryplay, and meta-dialoguing.\n\nSlaver: The MEGAMIX was converted to a slave ship after the star anvil was destroyed (signaling the commencement of the Ten-Thousand Year Hostilities). Zarquanian slavery is more brutal and monstrous than anything we humans could ever imagine (or even have the language to adequately describe). The slaves of Zarquans must at all time be kept away from anything that can be used as a makeshift weapon-not for fear of revolt, but because the slaves will commit suicide at the first possible chance. Airlocks on the MEGAMIX are a particular point of concern for ship security.\n\n<<Fake:///]: The Zarquanian Invasion is a Project Blue Beam production- yet another elaborate holographic hoax designed to distract the masses from the (all too real) Chicom/British Royal agenda. Let the opponent read the flavor text on this card, and steal real money from their wallet as they try to suss out the facts from the agitprop. They're reading this now, probably patting their pocket for their wallet.",
